# DEVELOP

## Quickstart

1. Dev setup:

   ```bash
   sh ./dev-setup.sh
   ```

   This will create some of the local symlinks you need (see details below).

2. Create a test React app and link it with your local plugin

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app react-app && cd react-app
   # make the local CSP plugin instance available in the React app
   # note that the symlink 'strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin' has been creaed at Step 1
   npm i --save strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin@beta
   npm link 'strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin'
   # eject so you can edit the webpack config to add CSP functionality to the React app
   npm run eject
   ```

   (Note: if you need to unlink later: `cd react-app && npm unlink 'strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin' && cd ..`)

3. Add CSP functionality to the React app

   In react-app's `webpack.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
   const StrictCspHtmlWebpackPlugin = require('strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin');

   module.exports = function (webpackEnv) {
     return {
       // ...
       plugins: [
         new HtmlWebpackPlugin(
           Object.assign(
             {}
             // ... HtmlWebpackPlugin config
           )
         ),
         new StrictCspHtmlWebpackPlugin(HtmlWebpackPlugin),
       ],
     };
   };
   ```

4. Startup:

   ```bash
   cd react-app && npm start
   ```

‚ú® That's it. Open `http://localhost:{port}` and inspect `index.html`. Observe that react app's `index.html` includes a valid hash-based CSP in a meta tag.

### Developing

#### When changing the library code (strict-csp)

üö® Every time you change strict-csp code, you need to **rebuild it** so that the changes are picked up by the strict csp webpack plugin. Build like this:

`cd strict-csp && npm run-script build && cd ..`

Note:

- If you've added new dependencies to strict-csp, also run `npm install` (as follows: `cd strict-csp && npm i && npm run-script build && cd ..`).
- No need to `link` again here, this only needs to be done once.

#### When changing the plugin code

Every time you change locally the plugin code (`strictCspWebpackPlugin.js`), you need to restart the react app with `npm start` to see the changes.

## How the development setup works

To develop this plugin locally, you need to create the symlinks as illustrated below. `dev-setup.sh` does this for you.
`undo-dev-setup.sh` undoes this (this is convenient if you need to debug `dev-setup.sh` itself).

Note: the **exact `html-webpack-plugin` instance** that `strict-csp-webpack-plugin` hooks into **must be referenced** by `strict-csp-webpack-plugin`, otherwise the hooking won't work and the CSP won't be set. It's a known thing with webpack and it's also the way other plugins that use `html-webpack-plugin` work. [Details](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1091).

## What `dev-setup.sh` does

- Builds the library, so that there's something to link to:
  `cd strict-csp && npm install && npm run-script build && cd ..`
- Creates a symlink to the library:
  `cd strict-csp && npm link && cd ..`
- Links to the library where needed:
  `cd strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin && npm link 'strict-csp' && cd ..`

This is done only once.

üßê Troubleshooting: if you get an error like "linked library not found", ensure that `main` in strict-csp's `package.json` points to a file that exists.

## To reset linking

`sh ./scripts/undo-dev-setup.sh`

## To troubleshoot individual linking issues

`npm uninstall`
`npm ls --depth=0 --link=true`
